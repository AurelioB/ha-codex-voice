## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Admit only one subscription-backed realtime speech session at a time and
  reject overlapping STT, TTS, or duplex requests immediately with HTTP 409,
  instead of allowing a losing WebRTC session to time out after 90 seconds.
- Retry transient WebRTC input-drain and missing-terminal-transcript stalls in
  fresh, fully cleaned sessions under one bounded transcription budget.
- Release speech-session admission after success, failure, timeout, or
  cancellation, and log privacy-safe audio level metrics when transcription
  reaches its deadline.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Run App Server in a mode-0700 temporary Codex home linked only to the managed
  file-backed ChatGPT login, keeping normal Codex history, configuration, apps,
  plugins, and MCP sidecars outside voice sessions.
- Persist threads only inside that private home and delete them when their
  bridge-managed lifetime ends, preventing finished Conversation, STT, TTS,
  and realtime threads from accumulating during App Server's idle-unload
  window.
- Audit effective configuration layers for injected MCP servers and accept
  bounded App Server JSON-RPC messages larger than asyncio's small default.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Restore the documented Python 3.11+ bridge compatibility and enforce it in
  CI with standalone bridge tests on the minimum supported Python version.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Bound conversation completion waits, with ambiguous turns interrupted and retired.
- Reject overlapping turns instead of allowing an unbounded background queue.
- Apply one deadline and bounded event backlog to realtime handshakes.
- Fail transcription promptly when app-server exits and bound accepted audio to
  60 seconds under an end-to-end request deadline.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Home Assistant Conversation, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech entities.
- Home Assistant LLM tool forwarding with bounded multi-turn conversation reuse.
- Local bearer-authenticated bridge using Codex-managed ChatGPT OAuth.
- Subscription-backed WebRTC v3 speech adapters and an experimental realtime
  duplex-audio WebSocket.
- HACS packaging, diagnostics, security hardening, tests, and live smoke tools.
