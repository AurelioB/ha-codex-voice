# Codex Voice bridge

This process exposes a small bearer-authenticated HTTP/WebSocket API to the
Home Assistant custom component and owns a local `codex app-server` child. The
child uses the machine's existing file-backed Codex/ChatGPT login through a
private temporary Codex home; no OAuth token is copied into Home Assistant.

## Run

Python 3.11 or newer, Codex CLI 0.147.0 or newer, and a working file-backed
`codex login` are required. The bridge auto-detects `auth.json` below
`CODEX_HOME` or `$HOME/.codex`; set `HA_CODEX_AUTH_FILE` to an absolute path
when it lives elsewhere. Keyring-only and group/world-readable credentials
fail closed.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r bridge/requirements.txt
export HA_CODEX_BRIDGE_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
export HA_CODEX_REALTIME_DEVICE_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
.venv/bin/python -m bridge
```

The default listener is `127.0.0.1:8787`. Override it with
`HA_CODEX_BRIDGE_HOST` and `HA_CODEX_BRIDGE_PORT`. `CODEX_APP_SERVER_COMMAND`
can replace the default hardened app-server command. The bridge creates
mode-0700 temporary `HOME`, `CODEX_HOME`, and runtime directories, linking only
the managed `auth.json`. It starts all Codex threads with the named
`ha-voice-minimal` least-privilege permission profile and `approvalPolicy:
never`. Threads persist only in that private home so the bridge can delete them
immediately when their managed lifetime ends. The default command grants only
Codex's minimal runtime paths and disables shell,
web, plugins, apps, MCP servers, hooks, and inherited command environment
variables. Startup and every new thread fail closed unless that profile is
available and active. Startup also audits App Server's effective configuration
layers and rejects any configured MCP server.

If the installed `codex` launcher depends on a Node.js interpreter that is not
available to the service, set `HA_CODEX_BINARY` to the absolute native Codex
executable. This replaces only the first executable in the default command and
preserves every hardened argument above. A complete
`CODEX_APP_SERVER_COMMAND` override takes precedence and remains responsible
for reproducing all required hardening.

Finite STT keeps a two-second fragment-quiet fallback by default. A deployment
that has passed short, long, paused, number, and name transcription trials may
set `HA_CODEX_TRANSCRIBE_LIVE_FRAGMENT_QUIET_SECONDS` between `0.5` and `2.0`.
Values below `2.0` are an explicit accuracy/latency tradeoff: local WebRTC input
drain does not prove that remote recognition has emitted its final fragment.
The shorter value is still gated on successful drain, a calibrated unity-gain
live feed, and no retained-session handoff.

If `CODEX_APP_SERVER_COMMAND` is overridden, it must enable the experimental
`realtime_conversation` feature. The bridge still injects and verifies the
profile selected by `HA_CODEX_PERMISSION_PROFILE` (default
`ha-voice-minimal`) on every thread. Do not weaken the inline profile or
replace it with legacy `read-only`, which permits broad host reads.

All routes, including `GET /health`, accept
`Authorization: Bearer <HA_CODEX_BRIDGE_TOKEN>`. The primary token retains
legacy realtime v1 compatibility. When the optional, distinct
`HA_CODEX_REALTIME_DEVICE_TOKEN` is set, it is accepted only for
`GET /v1/realtime` and only after the first start message successfully
negotiates strict v2. A device-token v1 or malformed negotiation is rejected
before provider/thread startup, and the device token is rejected by every
other route. This lets a speaker use content-private realtime audio without
storing the Home Assistant/component credential. In particular, the device
token cannot connect to `/v1/home-assistant/tools`; that authority route
requires the primary Home Assistant bridge token.

## API

- `GET /health`
- `GET /v1/conversation` WebSocket: `start`, streamed `delta`, `tool_call`,
  `tool_result`, and `done` messages. Stable Home Assistant `conversation_id`
  values reuse a bounded in-memory Codex thread for multi-turn context. A
  start may select `service_tier` as `standard` or `priority`; priority targets
  lower latency while increasing subscription usage. Its optional, bounded
  BCP-47 `language` is attached to every turn as trusted application context;
  the Home Assistant pipeline supplies `es-MX` for Mexican Spanish.
- `POST /v1/transcribe`: up to 60 seconds of base64 PCM16/WAV plus audio
  metadata; returns JSON `{ "text": "..." }` under a bounded end-to-end
  deadline.
- `GET /v1/transcribe/stream` WebSocket: a validated v1 start object, bounded
  binary PCM16 frames, and explicit `end`/`cancel` control. It returns one
  transcript result and lets bridge setup overlap Home Assistant capture.
- `POST /v1/synthesize`: text, voice, language, and an optional supported
  output tuple; returns mono 16-bit WAV at 16 or 24 kHz.
- `POST /v1/synthesize/stream`: the same request contract, returned as a
  progressively delivered mono PCM16 WAV stream at the requested supported
  rate.
- `POST /v1/speech-session/release`: idempotently release a private,
  unconsumed STT-to-TTS handoff ticket.
- `GET /v1/home-assistant/tools` WebSocket: one primary-token, Home
  Assistant-owned realtime tool authority. The first message registers a
  bounded immutable generation of rendered instructions, locale, and selected
  LLM API tools; correlated tool calls/results remain on this socket. The
  route-scoped realtime-device token is never accepted here.
- `GET /v1/realtime` WebSocket: legacy v1 JSON/base64 messages or the strict
  device-facing v2 binary PCM16 transport. V2 emits content-free lifecycle
  controls, filters continuous WebRTC silence, gates output with monotonic
  epochs, and supports negotiated same-session interruption. It does not expose
  transcripts, provider payloads, tool calls, or tool results to the device.
  A v2 `text` control is a bounded user message; its role must be omitted or
  exactly `user`. See the
  [v2 wire contract](../protocol/realtime-wire-v2.md).

Authenticated health includes a content-free `home_assistant_tools` object:
registration/open-transport readiness, locale, tool count, pending calls,
exclusive process-lifetime outcome counters, and the duration of the most
recent completed attempt. It never includes authority IDs, tool names,
schemas, arguments, results, prompts, or conversation content.

Device-facing v2 is the transport used by the pinned ThirdReality v1.1.7
in-process client. “Okay Computer” enters this direct mode; “Okay Nabu” remains
on Home Assistant's official Assist flow. The device sends 16 kHz mono PCM16
and receives 24 kHz mono PCM16. It remains an untrusted audio/control endpoint:
it cannot declare tools or send tool results. When exactly one Conversation
subentry is explicitly opted in, the Home Assistant component separately
registers that subentry's selected, bounded tool view with the primary token;
the bridge snapshots it for the v2 provider session. When strict wire v2,
realtime version v3, and that snapshot are all present, the bridge starts two
Codex threads: a tool-free realtime speech frontend and an isolated executor
that alone receives the selected tools. A completed frontend user transcript,
or a valid v2 user `text` control, starts an executor turn; each accepted
executor tool call is returned to Home Assistant for execution. Other protocol,
version, or authority combinations retain the native single-thread route. The
bridge applies a 2,250 ms input-track limit only to v2 live sessions; finite STT
keeps its existing whole-utterance input capacity.

The managed frontend starts with immutable routing instructions,
`clientManagedHandoffs: true`, and `delegationAckFiller: false`. App Server v3
can route native delegation before a notification is observable, so the
separate tool-bearing thread—not the prompt alone—is the authority boundary.
The frontend also disables unrelated repository startup context and admits the
device after the required `session.started`; v3 does not consistently emit a
separate startup context acknowledgement.
Any frontend, foreign, stale, or post-interrupt tool call is answered with
`unowned_home_assistant_tool_call` and `do_not_retry: true` without invoking
Home Assistant. An identified raw v3 user `turn.created`/`turn.done` pair—not
the identity-free normalized transcript notification—owns each microphone
request. On a completed executor turn, the bridge selects the final agent
answer and sends one valid UTF-8 prefix of at most 500 bytes to the frontend
with `thread/realtime/appendSpeech`. It drops frontend PCM until
`session.context.appended` acknowledges the append and a session-unique
assistant `turn.created` identifies and arms the current bridge generation.
The first authorized non-silent PCM begins the speaking epoch, and only the
matching assistant `turn.done` releases the serialized render slot;
unsolicited, replayed, and stale audio remains inaudible. Managed v3 ignores
response/output-buffer lifecycle aliases. Codex 0.147 frameless cancellation
terminates through the identified turn lifecycle; a missing matching terminal
fails the next render closed rather than permitting overlap.

Executor completion is independently bounded by the configured bridge request
timeout. A failed terminal or expired turn returns a generic device error and
closes the session instead of waiting indefinitely. Stop, disconnect, and
service shutdown tombstone and interrupt an active executor before its event
subscription closes; transport and two-thread deletion then continue in
tracked, cancellation-shielded cleanup.

The reference device keeps at most 64 KiB (2.048 s) of startup/fallback input,
drains a post-handshake backlog at no more than 2× capture rate, and keeps at
most 48 KiB (about 1.024 s) queued for playback. Provider output also crosses a
bounded bridge queue. A bound violation is terminal or triggers the documented
pre-ready Home Assistant fallback; audio is never silently discarded to make
latency metrics look better. Catch-up prevents a permanent handshake-sized
offset once v2 becomes ready, but it cannot make the cold App Server/WebRTC
handshake or provider response generation disappear.

The device mode is turn-taking by default. Opt-in full duplex is a device-side
contract: the pinned client must verify the reviewed static PulseAudio
`module-echo-cancel` topology with the exact configured allowlisted AEC engine,
exact source/sink and capture-process routing, and a 1–25% sink ceiling before
it opens this route. WebRTC is the default when no method is supplied; there is
no automatic fallback. The stock ThirdReality v1.1.7 module rejects WebRTC and
Speex, so its qualified configuration must explicitly select Adrian. The client
rechecks the ceiling before every response and pins `paplay` to the AEC sink
with the same fixed stream-volume ceiling.

V2 advertises `remote_cancel: false` because clients may never infer remote
cancellation from a local flush. It separately advertises
`same_session_interrupt_ack: true`. The current ThirdReality client negotiates
the managed policy with `User-Agent: ha-codex-voice-thirdreality/2`. On a
broker-managed interrupt, the bridge invalidates the executor/output generation
and asks the frontend provider to cancel only when an identified assistant
render is active; it never cancels an idle or pending frontend. Before Home
Assistant tool dispatch it tombstones and interrupts the executor turn; after dispatch it
lets the tool-bearing turn settle, suppresses the old final, and queues the
newest request when its transcript arrives.
It then returns `fresh_session_required: false`, `remote_cancelled: false`, and
`continuation_safe: true`; the local generation gate makes continuation safe
without claiming remote cancellation. A legacy client gets the established
fresh-session fallback and socket teardown. On the native path, same-socket
continuation still requires a sanitized `response.cancelled` event correlated
to the active provider response.

Audio uses Codex app-server's experimental WebRTC v3 path by default. The peer
creates a real paced outbound audio track and `oai-events` data channel before
the SDP offer; app-server supplies the remote SDP answer and transcript
notifications. Codex 0.147.0 or newer is required for the managed frontend's
delegation acknowledgement control. This is the subscription-compatible path.
Raw Realtime v2 WebSockets require API-key authentication and are intentionally
not used.

The subscription realtime voice is conversational, not a verbatim
text-to-speech API. `/v1/synthesize` sends a tightly constrained text turn but
still provides best-effort conversational speech and returns the header
`X-Codex-Synthesis-Mode: conversational-best-effort`; callers must not assume
that spoken wording exactly matches the input. A cold `appendSpeech` variant
was also tested through the official Home Assistant `tts.speak` path and
timed out at 90.047 s with HTTP 504; the constrained `appendText` turn remains
the supported implementation.

## Streaming STT and guarded session-handoff experiment

The component opens `/v1/transcribe/stream` before it reads Home Assistant's
microphone iterator. Once the bridge validates the start object, it starts the
Codex thread and realtime WebRTC handshake concurrently with capture. The
bridge performs one bounded level calibration after it observes sustained
speech, then normalizes and feeds subsequent audio while capture continues.
Quiet or ambiguous captures remain buffered until explicit EOF. The complete
raw capture is retained so a retry always starts in a fresh session with a
whole-utterance normalization pass. This preserves Home Assistant's finite STT
result while allowing remote recognition to overlap capture.

The bundled component does not request STT-to-TTS session handoff. Live
realtime v3 validation found that the remote session can begin assistant output
before finite STT completes, while the supported Frameless Bidi client protocol
has no response-cancel message. The official Assist path therefore uses a
fresh TTS session.

The bridge retains the experimental wire schema and validation machinery for
future protocol work, but the released build never retains the STT session or
issues a ticket. A request containing the following field is validated and then
takes the same isolated cold path; production clients should omit it.

```json
{
  "speech_session_handoff": {
    "version": 1,
    "voice": "cove",
    "language": "en-US"
  }
}
```

The dormant protocol defines a versioned random 256-bit ticket, its voice,
normalized language, and `expires_in_ms: 30000`. The handoff language must
normalize to the same tag as the outer transcription metadata. If a future
causally safe implementation enables it, a compatible `/v1/synthesize` or
`/v1/synthesize/stream` request may present the ticket once as
`speech_session_handoff_token` with that same language. The bridge then uses
`appendSpeech` on the sanitized STT session instead of creating a second
thread and WebRTC session. Only one offer can be outstanding on the bridge's
single speech lane.

The released bridge does not reach ticket issuance. The dormant machinery
stores only a ticket's SHA-256 digest and never logs the raw value. In that
protocol, the bearer-authenticated request/response transport carries the
ticket, and Home Assistant would bind it in memory to the exact bridge client,
`ChatSession`, official pre-STT TTS preparation, voice, and language. Custom
TTS instructions, another client/session, direct `tts.speak`, mismatch,
expiry, remote output, or remote failure cannot implicitly claim it. An
incompatible request closes the offer before taking the normal cold path. If
an already-claimed reuse attempt fails before first PCM, synthesis may
cold-start within its original deadline; it never restarts after PCM has been
exposed to the caller.

The release route accepts
`{ "speech_session_handoff_token": "..." }` and returns `204` even when a
matching offer has already expired or been cleaned. Expiry, explicit release,
replacement, shutdown, cancellation, and successful consumption converge on
the same exactly-once session stop and thread deletion. Tickets are bearer
secrets despite their short lifetime and must stay out of URLs, logs, task
names, and diagnostics.

The bridge intentionally does not maintain an always-on remote prewarm. An
idle WebRTC peer continues emitting silent RTP, would occupy the single speech
lane, and has no documented quota-neutral lifetime. The supported optimization
is capture overlap plus progressive TTS delivery. See
[performance and ThirdReality tuning](../docs/performance.md) for live
measurement scope and the prewarm rationale.

Finite transcription does not append synthetic silence by default. Set
`HA_CODEX_TRANSCRIBE_SILENCE_MS` only when an explicit nonzero compatibility
tail is required. Successful STT and TTS attempts log numeric stage durations
only; speech, transcripts, prompts, credentials, SDP, and remote identifiers
are never included in those timing records. Streaming STT also logs capture,
handshake/capture overlap, post-capture, and total durations so deployments can
verify overlap without recording content.

Interactive approvals, permission requests, and unsupported server-initiated
requests fail closed. Only explicitly declared dynamic Home Assistant tools are
relayed to the official Conversation WebSocket, a legacy v1 realtime client,
or the isolated executor of a managed v2 session bound to the current Home
Assistant broker generation. The managed speech frontend has no tools and its
unexpected requests are explicitly rejected. V2 devices never declare,
receive, or answer tool calls themselves. Exactly one
explicitly opted-in Conversation subentry may register at most 128 tools; tool
schemas, arguments, results, pending calls, and per-session calls are bounded.
Home Assistant renders the authority instructions, defaults its realtime
locale to `es-MX`, executes calls through the selected LLM API, and returns
correlated results. Missing, ambiguous, replaced, disconnected, timed-out, or
invalid authority fails closed. The component uses the `conversation`
assistant exposure namespace, matching the official Conversation flow. The
deadline hierarchy is 25 seconds for tool execution, 5 seconds for component
result delivery, 35 seconds for the complete bridge broker transaction, 5
seconds for provider-result delivery, and a 45-second App Server fallback.
Unknown outcomes carry `do_not_retry`, disable further authority calls in that
session, and cannot be amplified with fresh provider IDs. A 20-second
post-result continuation watchdog bounds a provider/App Server wedge.
